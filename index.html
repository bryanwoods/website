      <p>
        I'm an advisor to startups and founders.
      </p>
      <p>
        I cofounded <a href="https://www.sayrhino.com">Rhino</a>, which created a new industry in security deposit insurance, has saved renters billions of dollars, and has generated hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before that, I was a founding or seed stage engineer at startups that were acquired by Facebook, IAC, Samsung, and Nike.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been building web software since the '90s and venture-backed startups since the aughts.
